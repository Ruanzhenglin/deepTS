## deepTS
- deepTS is a web-based Galaxy platform exploring transcriptional switch events from large-scale RNA sequencing data.
- deepTS consists of three main functional modules, covering the processes of read cleaning and mapping; transcriptome map construction; expression abundance estimation; and TS identification, visualization, and exploration. In addition, deepTS provides a series of mutually independent, end-to-end functions, including multiple-algorithm expression abundance estimation (e.g., StringTie, salmon), multiple-condition TS analysis pipelines, multiple-level TS characterization, and multiple-form visualization, to allow users to perform TS analysis using either raw RNA-Seq data or expression abundance matrices directly.
